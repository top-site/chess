#    - Any UCI-compatible engine will work
#    - Update engine_path in chessgui4.py accordingly
#
# ENGINE CONFIGURATION:
# After installing an engine, update the engine_path variable in chessgui4.py:
# - If engine is in PATH: self.engine_path = "stockfish"
# - Full path: self.engine_path = "/usr/bin/stockfish" (Linux/Mac)
# - Full path: self.engine_path = r"C:\stockfish\stockfish.exe" (Windows)

# ===================================================================
# SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

# - Python 3.7 or higher
# - Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
# - Memory: Minimum 512MB RAM (1GB+ recommended for engine battles)
# - Disk Space: ~50MB for application + engine size
# - Display: Minimum 1024x768 resolution

# ===================================================================
# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
# ===================================================================
# 1. Install Python dependencies:
#    pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# 2. Install a chess engine (see ENGINE REQUIREMENTS above)
#
# 3. Configure engine path in chessgui4.py
